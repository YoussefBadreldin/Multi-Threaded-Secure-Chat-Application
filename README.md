# Multi-Threaded-Secure-Chat-Application

### Part 1: Server and Client Setup

#### 1.1 Server Initialization
- Developed a robust Java program for a simple server capable of listening on a specified port.
- Implemented error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected situations.

#### 1.2 Client Connection
- Created a corresponding client program that establishes a socket connection with the server.
- Ensured secure and reliable communication between the client and server.
- Implemented a message exchange where the client sends a message, and the server responds with a confirmation message.

### Part 2: Multi-Threaded Server

#### 2.1 Multi-Threaded Architecture
- Extended the server functionality to become multi-threaded, capable of handling multiple client connections concurrently.
- Implemented a robust mechanism for managing and coordinating threads, ensuring efficient communication.

#### 2.2 Simple Protocol Implementation
- Developed a simple communication protocol allowing clients to send and receive messages through the server.
- Decided on a standard format for messages exchanged between clients and the server.

#### 2.3 Dynamic Thread Management
- Implemented a dynamic thread management system, allowing the server to adapt to varying loads and optimize resource usage.

##### 2.3.1 Thread Pool Implementation
- Enhanced the multi-threaded server by implementing a thread pool for efficient thread reuse and resource management.

### Part 3: Secure Chat Application Enhancement

#### 3.1 Chat Server Implementation
- Transformed the multi-threaded server into a full-fledged chat server.
- Enabled clients to connect and engage in real-time conversations through the server.
- Implemented broadcasting functionality to distribute messages to all connected clients.

#### 3.2 Advanced Features
- Enhanced the chat application with features such as nickname assignment and private messaging.

#### 3.3 Socket-level Encryption
- Implemented socket-level encryption to secure the communication channel between the server and clients, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of messages.

#### 3.4 Error Handling and Resilience
- Developed advanced error handling mechanisms and resilience features to recover from network errors, ensuring a stable and uninterrupted chat experience.

### Part 4: File Transfer

#### 4.1 File Transfer Protocol Design
- Defined a robust file transfer protocol that includes specifications for file metadata, data packet structure, and error handling mechanisms.

#### 4.2 Client-Side Implementation
- Enhanced the client-side of the application to support file selection and initiate the file transfer process.
- Implemented a user-friendly interface for selecting and sending files, allowing clients to choose files from their local storage.

#### 4.3 Server-Side Handling
- Extended the server-side functionality to receive incoming file transfers, manage file storage, and appropriately handle file-related requests.
- Implemented mechanisms to organize and store received files on the server securely.

#### 4.4 Error Handling
- Implemented robust error handling mechanisms to address issues that may arise during file transfers.
- Defined error codes and messages to communicate specific issues, enabling clients and the server to respond appropriately.

### Advanced Networking Concepts

#### 4.1 Proxy Server Integration
- Integrated a proxy server into the architecture to demonstrate a more complex network topology.
- Implemented secure communication between the proxy server and the main chat server.

#### 4.2 Load Balancing
- Implemented a load balancing mechanism to distribute incoming client connections evenly among multiple chat servers.

#### 4.3 Network Protocol Optimization
- Optimized the chat application's network protocol for efficiency, reducing latency and resource consumption.
