# Multi-Threaded-Secure-Chat-Application

### Objective
The primary goal of this project is to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of advanced socket programming in Java, emphasizing multi-threading, security, and advanced networking concepts. The project is divided into multiple parts, each building upon the previous one to progressively enhance the functionality of the server and client.

### Part 1: Server and Client Setup

#### 1.1 Server Initialization
- Develop a robust Java program for a simple server capable of listening on a specified port.
- Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected situations.

#### 1.2 Client Connection
- Create a corresponding client program that establishes a socket connection with the server.
- Ensure secure and reliable communication between the client and server.
- Implement a message exchange where the client sends a message, and the server responds with a confirmation message.

#### 1.3 Documentation and Code Comments
- Thoroughly document the server and client setup, explaining the purpose and functionality of each component.
- Provide detailed code comments to enhance code readability.

### Part 2: Multi-Threaded Server

#### 2.1 Multi-Threaded Architecture
- Extend the server functionality to become multi-threaded, capable of handling multiple client connections concurrently.
- Implement a robust mechanism for managing and coordinating threads, ensuring efficient communication.

#### 2.2 Simple Protocol Implementation
- Develop a simple communication protocol allowing clients to send and receive messages through the server.
- Decide on a standard format for messages exchanged between clients and the server.

#### 2.3 Dynamic Thread Management
- Implement a dynamic thread management system, allowing the server to adapt to varying loads and optimize resource usage.

##### 2.3.1 Thread Pool Implementation
- Enhance the multi-threaded server by implementing a thread pool for efficient thread reuse and resource management.

#### 2.4 Documentation and Code Comments
- Extend documentation to cover the multi-threaded aspects of the server.
- Add comprehensive comments to the code to explain the purpose of each thread, synchronization mechanism, and features.

### Part 3: Secure Chat Application Enhancement

#### 3.1 Chat Server Implementation
- Transform the multi-threaded server into a full-fledged chat server.
- Enable clients to connect and engage in real-time conversations through the server.
- Implement broadcasting functionality to distribute messages to all connected clients.

#### 3.2 Advanced Features
- Enhance the chat application with features such as nickname assignment and private messaging.

#### 3.3 Socket-level Encryption
- Implement socket-level encryption to secure the communication channel between the server and clients, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of messages.

#### 3.4 Error Handling and Resilience
- Develop advanced error handling mechanisms and resilience features to recover from network errors, ensuring a stable and uninterrupted chat experience.

#### 3.5 Documentation and Code Comments
- Update documentation to cover the additional features, security enhancements, and error handling mechanisms.
- Ensure that the code comments reflect the new functionalities introduced in this phase.

### Part 4: File Transfer

#### 4.1 File Transfer Protocol Design
- Define a robust file transfer protocol that includes specifications for file metadata, data packet structure, and error handling mechanisms.

#### 4.2 Client-Side Implementation
- Enhance the client-side of the application to support file selection and initiate the file transfer process.
- Implement a user-friendly interface for selecting and sending files, allowing clients to choose files from their local storage.

#### 4.3 Server-Side Handling
- Extend the server-side functionality to receive incoming file transfers, manage file storage, and appropriately handle file-related requests.
- Implement mechanisms to organize and store received files on the server securely.

#### 4.4 Error Handling
- Implement robust error handling mechanisms to address issues that may arise during file transfers.
- Define error codes and messages to communicate specific issues, enabling clients and the server to respond appropriately.

#### 4.5 Documentation and Code Comments
- Update documentation to cover the file transfer functionality, including details on the protocol, security measures, and error handling.
- Provide comprehensive comments in the code to explain the purpose and implementation details of each file transfer feature.

### Advanced Networking Concepts

#### 4.1 Proxy Server Integration
- Integrate a proxy server into the architecture to demonstrate a more complex network topology.
- Implement secure communication between the proxy server and the main chat server.

#### 4.2 Load Balancing
- Implement a load balancing mechanism to distribute incoming client connections evenly among multiple chat servers.

#### 4.3 Network Protocol Optimization
- Optimize the chat application's network protocol for efficiency, reducing latency and resource consumption.

#### 4.4 Documentation and Code Comments
- Document the integration of the proxy server and advanced networking concepts.
- Provide comprehensive comments in the code to explain the purpose and implementation details.
